<p>If you have been following Zense then you must remember how did the old website look. Yes we know it was bad and that's why we always wanted to move out away from it. So after a few failed projects, we have finally managed to put together a basic portal. This is still a work in progress but we have planned a lot of things and hopefully everything turns out well.</p>
<p>Some things to look out for in the new website (Many features are still pending):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://zense.co.in/blog/">A dedicated blog section</a> : Look out for different tech articles and our latest news in this section.</li>
<li><a href="http://zense.co.in/projects/">Projects section</a> : It is for showcasing the work that we have done.</li>
<li><a href="http://zense.co.in/members/">Members section</a>: Finally a section which contains profile for all our members and contributors.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are actively looking to make this website better, this is still work in progress!</p>
