<p>I took a session on 16th October on Database Design. The objective of that session was to give members an idea about basic database design rules so that they can code ROR apps easily.</p>
<p>Some pointers to follow up on that session are. Follow them in order :</p>
<p><a href="http://www.studytonight.com/dbms/er-diagram" target="_blank">http://www.studytonight.com/dbms/er-diagram</a> -&gt; If you did not understand the relationship modelling part properly, this link might help.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/sql/</a> -&gt; If you don't have idea about sql then I strongly recommend you to go through this, it will take very less time and you can quickly get hold of sql.</p>
<p><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html" target="_blank">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html</a>Â -&gt; This article talks about how relationships can be modelled in a rails app. If you understood everything in the last class you can easily follow this.</p>
