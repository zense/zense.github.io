<p>Docker can be a difficult tool to get hold of initially. But once you get hold of it then it will change the way you do your work.</p>
<p>Docker right now is primarily used by large organizations for rapidly deploying applications at scale. Industry is quickly moving from the traditional monolithic architecture to modern distributed architectures. Instead of increasing the hardware capacity on a single system it is now more preferred to distribute the application on a pool of servers, indeed it comes with its own baggage of complications. You can't just migrate a traditional monolith app to a distributed application overnight but it is happening right now.</p>
<p>As students also docker can be a very useful tool for us. Especially if you are working on team projects and need to setup the development environment on multiple systems. I remember the first time I started working on a Rails project I had to struggleÂ  a lot to finally get a rails environment up and running. Even after I had the environment up and running after a few days I had to work on a Rails app which required different version of Ruby and I ended up reinstalling entire ruby, If I recollect properly then I wasted almost 10-15 hours in total just to get the environment working properly. I agree there are some good soltuions out there to solve the ruby versioning problem (like rvm and rbenv) but when I was a beginner I had no idea about those tools and it took me a while to get hold of them.</p>
<p>How can docker help you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a development environment which can be cloned instantly with anyone else</li>
<li>Works on my system, I dont' know why it doesn't work on yours?</li>
</ul>

<p>How is docker different from Virtual Machines</p>
<p>Docker is not a VM.</p>
