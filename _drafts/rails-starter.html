<p><strong>Why Rails ??</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First of all it is very fast to code a project in rails. So have a this knowledge with us will be a very big advantage during coding competitions and hackathons. </li>
<li>It follows Convention over configuration which helps the programmer a lot during decision making.</li>
<li>Rails has a very huge developer community. So having the project in rails will give us a very big advantage as support is huge.</li>
<li>As the rails user-base is increasing exponentially, the chances of this getting outdated is very slim.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Controllers</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Controller is the place where the logic of the program is written.</li>
<li>It receives all the requests from the application.</li>
<li>The received requests are processed here and </li>
</ol>
<p>it will be more clear as we go through one example.</p>
<p><strong>Models</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Models are nothing but your data bases.</li>
<li>These are ruby classes where information are stored or retrieved.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Views</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Views contain the dynamic web pages that the users will be seeing.</li>
<li>It is written in a special format called Embedded Ruby(.erb)</li>
<li>These are the only things that a user will be seeing while Models and controllers are kept behind the curtains.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">The official documentation explains the work flow in the best possible way with examples</a></p>
<p>And Do learn about rails-scaffolding which generates the entire work that was done in the above tutorial in just one terminal command  :)</p>
<p><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Going through all these will give deeper insights.</a></p>
<p>Other Thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is better to keep 3 terminals open
<ol>
<li>for rails c (rails console, this can be used during testing for manipulating data in server side without touching the website)</li>
<li>rails s (for rails server)</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
